# libft-GNL-printf

C programming can be very tedious when one doesnâ€™t have access to those highly useful
standard functions. This project gives you the opportunity to re-write those functions,
understand them, and learn to use them. This library will help you for all your future C
projects.
Through this project, we also give you the opportunity to expand the list of functions
with your own. Take the time to expand your libft throughout the year.

## Technical considerations
-  It is forbidden to use global variables.
-  If you need subfunctions to write a complex function, you should define these subfunctions as static to avoid publishing them with your library. It would be a good
habit to do this in your future projects as well.
-  You must use the command ar to create your librairy, using the command libtool
is forbidden.
